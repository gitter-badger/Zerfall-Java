A Java 8 version of the Processing game Zerfall. Zerfall is Exoplanet Software's first *legitimate* game, so we're trying quite hard to make it the best it can be.

Honestly, if you asked me what the point of playing this game is, I'd have a hard time coming up with an answer. It doesn't feature any revolutionary gameplay, nor does it have extraordinary graphics. But it was a labor of love, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.

Zerfall is German for decay, which makes sense, because this game is a 2D wave-based zombie survival platformer similar to Treyarch Studios' Call of Duty Zombies.
