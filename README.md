### What is this pile of spaghetti code?

A Java 8 version of the Processing game Zerfall, built in Eclipse. Zerfall is Exoplanet Software's first *legitimate* game, so we're trying quite hard to make it the best it can be.

Zerfall is German for decay, which makes sense, because this game is a 2D wave-based zombie survival platformer similar to Treyarch Studios' Call of Duty Zombies.
