### What is this pile of spaghetti code?
A Java 8 version of the Processing game Zerfall, built in Eclipse Neon. I really need to stop changing programming languages.
### What's Zerfall? What does that word even mean?
Zerfall is German for the word "decay", which makes sense, because Zerfall is a zombie survival platformer.
